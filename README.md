# Hello there!

 I am a computer engineering techologist at a Hungarian university.  
 Mainly coding in Javascript & Typescript, but I have some other projects as well.  
 This site is under construction and projects and codes will be uploaded whenever they are finished.  

Fun facts:  
 C++ actually a good language </>  
 The third best feeling in the world is coding all night ⚙️  
 Assembly is my arch enemy 👾  
 Programing isnt hard its just not for everyone ⚠️
